# Lawtext syntax

Please refer to the comments in the following documents for the detailed syntax of Lawtext.

- The documentation for [`Line`](/lib/core/modules/core_src_node_cst_line.md#line) describes the types of `Line`s and links to the codes that contain the actual syntax definition by [`generic-parser`](https://github.com/yamachig/generic-parser) to convert a Lawtext string to a sequence of `Line`s.
- The documentation for [`VirtualLine`](/lib/core/modules/core_src_parser_std_virtualLine.md#virtualline) describes the types of `VirtualLine`s and the steps to convert a sequence of `Line`s to `VirtualLine`s.
- The documentation for [`$law`](/lib/core/modules/core_src_parser_std_rules__law.md#law) is the entry point of the parser that converts a sequence of `VirtualLine`s to [`StdEL`](/lib/core/modules/core_src_law_std_stdEL.md#stdel). It contains the actual syntax definition by [`generic-parser`](https://github.com/yamachig/generic-parser), and you can follow the defined rule to find syntax definitions for other element types.
